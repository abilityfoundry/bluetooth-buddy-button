# 🟢 Buddy Button

**Open-Source Accessibility. One Click at a Time.**

The Buddy Button is an open-source Bluetooth-enabled switch designed for accessibility. Built to be 3D printed and easily assembled, this device enables users with limited mobility to interact with computers, tablets, or phones using a single press.

Created by [**Ability Foundry**](https://github.com/abilityfoundry), this project is part of our mission to build inclusive, impactful, and low-cost assistive technology tools for everyday use.
